#A simple experiment to make our own measurements of the evaporation of water and the absorption of water by DMSO and how sealing prevents these

## Relavent Scripts
- Momentum Process: WIP_SMH_DMSOH2Osealtest
- Momentum Experiment: E_WIP_SMH_DMSOH2Osealtest
- EVO: WIP_SMH_DMSOH2Osealtest

## Procedure
- Weigh each of four 4ti-0110 plates
- Put plates on Hotel 1
- Place two troughs on the EVO deck: one of DMSO and one of water 
- Run Momentum Script (this will give you four plates:
 - 100 ul DMSO in each well
 - 100 ul DMSO in each well, sealed
 - 100 ul H2O in each well
 - 100 ul H2O in each well, sealed
- Weigh plates
- Pick an interval of time over which to continue weighing plates
